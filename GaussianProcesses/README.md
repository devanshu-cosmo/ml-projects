Stock Return Prediction Using Gaussian Processes and PCA
Overview
This notebook contains a comprehensive Jupyter notebook that explores advanced supervised learning techniques for predicting stock returns, focusing on Gaussian Process (GP) regression and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-enhanced GP modeling. The aim is to provide robust, interpretable, and uncertainty-aware return predictions leveraging both market technical indicators and macroeconomic data.

Objectives
Implement Gaussian Process regression to model and predict the daily returns of Microsoft (MSFT) stock.

Incorporate PCA for dimensionality reduction of financial features, improving stability and interpretability of the GP model.

Evaluate and compare the predictive accuracy of GP versus PCA+GP models using appropriate error and goodness-of-fit metrics.

Visually analyze model predictions with associated confidence intervals to assess uncertainty.

Conduct in-depth PCA analysis, including explained variance, component loadings, and feature correlation structure.

Provide backtesting methods (included within the notebook) to assess the practical trading performance of the developed predictive models.

Methodology & Workflow
Data Acquisition: Retrieve historical price data for MSFT and S&P 500, supplemented by technical indicators and optional macroeconomic factors via the FRED API.

Feature Engineering: Calculate a rich set of features, including returns, moving averages, momentum, volatility, and lagged variables, ensuring alignment and rigorous preprocessing.

Modeling: Build GP regression models using both raw and PCA-transformed features to predict next-day returns.

Evaluation: Quantitatively measure performance with mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) metrics, comparing raw GP and PCA-enhanced GP.

Visualization: Present clear plots of actual vs predicted returns, confidence intervals, comparison charts for both modeling approaches, and PCA interpretability visuals.

Backtesting: Simulate trading strategies based on model signals to evaluate profitability and risk characteristics.
